# Eye Gaze Detection System

## Overview
This project implements an Eye Gaze Detection system using computer vision techniques.
It tracks eye movements through a webcam and determines the gaze direction in real time.

## Problem Statement
Many users, especially physically challenged individuals, face difficulty interacting
with computers using traditional input devices. There is also a need to monitor attention
and eye movement in educational and research applications.

## Solution
The proposed system uses facial landmark detection to locate eyes and analyze eye movement
to estimate gaze direction without the need for any special hardware.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe / Dlib
- Webcam

## Applications
- Assistive technology for disabled users
- Human–Computer Interaction
- Online learning attention monitoring
- Research and behavior analysis

## Future Scope
- Improve accuracy using deep learning
- Mobile application support
- Integration with screen control features
